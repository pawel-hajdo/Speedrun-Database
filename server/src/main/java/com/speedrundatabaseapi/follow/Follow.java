 * Entity class representing the relationship between users for following.

 * <p>The Follow class is used to store information about users who follow other users.
 * It includes details such as follower, following, and the time when the follow occurred.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class is annotated with JPA annotations for mapping to the database table.
 * The unique constraint ensures that a user can only follow another user once.</p>
 *
 * <p>The follow time is automatically set to the current date and time before persisting
 * the entity in the database.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class is also annotated with a custom JSON serializer for handling JSON serialization.</p>
